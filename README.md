## Transfers

**DeBridgeGate**

Contract for assets transfers. The user can transfer the asset to any of the approved chains. The admin manages the assets, fees and other important protocol parameters.

The detailed methods description can be found in the contracts themselves.

## Chainlink

**AggregatorBase**

The base contract for Chainlink oracles management. Allows to add/remove oracles, manage the minimal required amount of confirmations and assign oracle admins.

**ConfirmationAggregator**

Extends the **AggregatorBase** with confirmation-related methods; is deployed to the chain with low fees and is used to collect confirmations from oracles.

**SignatureAggregator**

Extends the **AggregatorBase** with confirmation-related methods; is deployed to the chain with low fees and is used to collect signatures from oracles that confirm the transfers.

**SignatureVerifier.sol**

Is deployed to the chain with high fees and is used to verify the transfer by oracles signatures.

## Oracles

Contains variety of the contracts interfaces.

**DelegatedStaking**

Manages oracle and delegator stakes. Oracles are required to stake LINK token to be accepted as an oracle on aggregators.

## Periphery

**WrappedAsset**

ERC20 token that is used as wrapped asset to represent the native token value on the other chains.

**DefiController**

Mock contract responsible for using the asset from the Debridge contracts in other DeFi protocols to earn extra reward.

**FeeProxy**

Helper to swap any token to Link. \*\*\*\*

**CallProxy**

Proxy to execute the other contract calls. This contract is used when the user requests transfer with specific call of other contract.

**Pausable**

Helper for pausable contracts.

## Test

```
yarn start-ganache 
```
Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill it with your testnet settings: 

Where `MNEMONIC` & `TEST_ORACLE_KEYS` & `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` are the values from the  from ganache testnet

```
yarn test
```
